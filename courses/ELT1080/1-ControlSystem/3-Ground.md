You've likely seen the word "ground" before. In Canada, every power outlet has a ground. It's the bottom hole in electrical outlets.

You might have wondered before what that hole is for. Isn't electricity just a loop? Where does the ground go?

Ground is actually a strange concept. It originates from the time of telegraphs. But first, let's distinguish between two definitions.

### Ground as protection
One of the sources of confusion about ground is the word's two usages. The most popular way to describe ground is the protection of circuits. This can be for high voltage components, or electrostatic-sensitive devices. Electricity finds the fastest route to the ground, so having a conductive material straight to the ground helps.

But this definition leaves many important usages behind.

### Ground as a return path
This definition is much more broad. It actually includes the first one. But it's important to remember that ground is used in many other applications.

In situations where running wires for very long distances is necessary, such as telegraphs, using ground is literal. You can actually use the earth as a conductive material to complete a circuit. Of course, this yields some disadvantages.

You might ask how electricity knows where to go once it is in the ground. It doesn't. We just think of ground as a conductor for convenience. What actually happens is that the earth acts as a "sink" for electrons, providing a place for electrons to go. It is actually possible for ground to act as a positive or negative terminal.

But ground doesn't necessarily mean "ground" as in earth. Things like vehicles, cell phones and many others have grounds. These are just fancy names for common reciprocals for electricity.

### Example
You could set up your relay to talk to your friend to use ground. It would look like this:

Notice that you now only need two wires that go from your friend's house to yours now. Although this doesn't seem like a big deal in your situation, it certainly is for large scale communications.

Many different devices use grounds to make circuits simpler. It removes the need to use extraneous amounts of wire. Its only disadantage is the possibility that the voltage is not high enough to use an earth ground. For example, you could not use an earth ground for a AA battery with a lightbulb, since 1.5V isn't enough to attract enough electrons from the ground.

Note that all of this is basically a formality - **ground is a zero voltage reference**. Technically, all it is is a place for you to call 0V.
