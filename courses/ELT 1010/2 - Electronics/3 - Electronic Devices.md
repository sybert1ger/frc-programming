With the various kinds of electrical components, there are devices that can be created. These devices are useful when making anything electronic.

## Processors
Processors are the base of computers. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the most important part of a computer. Processors are also used in all kinds of portable devices.

A processor is defined by its ability to perform an action given to it.

## Micro-controllers
Micro-controllers are similar to processors, but are defined by their inability to perform actions given to it. They are mostly important for embedded systems. Many processors use micro-controllers to perform functions that they cannot.

Microwaves, ovens, fridges and many other appliances use micro-controllers to behave properly.

## Common Devices
Along with processors and micro-controllers, many computer parts are very common. Motherboards are used in all computers, screens are used in almost every modern device and keyboards/mouses are just as popular.

It's important to realise how useful the simple electronic concepts are in the real world. Understanding how these work is critical to understanding the bigger ideas of modern technology.
