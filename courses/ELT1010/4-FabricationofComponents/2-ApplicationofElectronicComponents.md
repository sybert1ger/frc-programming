Once you know about all of the different electronic components, how they work and how to solder them together, you can start to build on that knowledge. 

## Electronic Devices
### Computers
Computers rely on [transistors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor). Almost like a microscopic "switch", transistors use atomic properties to store a state using non-mechanical devices. To learn more about transistors, look at this video.

Computers use [logic gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) in complex circuits to complete certain actions. [This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0253EC51AF4109D0) video series explains these things from the bottom-up.

### Screens
Screens come in many different kinds. This is just one example of how screens work.

### Household Appliances
Most household appliances are [embedded systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system). Embedded systems use micro-controllers to control their functions consistently and quickly.

## Communications
Communications use wired or wireless signals. In the digital era we are in today, most of communications happens in binary. This means that everything sent to and from a communicator is encoded in 0s and 1s. In the electronics of communications, this is simply a voltage turning on and off very quickly. Recently, optical signals are being used to transmit data faster, at the speed of light.

## Systems
There are a lot of systems in the world that rely on the efficiency, reliability and usefulness of electronics. To most people, the actual uses for electronics in the modern world are becoming abstracted by things like computers, wireless signals and the internet. Unfortunately, the link to basic electronics is lost when these things are thought of as technology "bigger" than just plain circuits. In fact, they are just that - circuits. The abstractness leads people to think that electronics is being replaced by something, when in fact it is electronics that are doing the replacing.
