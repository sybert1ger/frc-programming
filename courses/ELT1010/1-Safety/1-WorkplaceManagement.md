Before learning about the basics, you need to learn how to be safe. Safety is a critical component in all industries, and is especially important when dealing with electronics. The next three modules will give an outline of the expected safety precautions you should take, and how to remain safe when using electronics.

An especially important part of remaining safe is your workplace. The area and atmosphere that you work in is crucial to being safe. It isn't sufficient to concentrate on the procedures and precautions of safety. The "build space" that you use is very important and should not be neglected.

## Organization
At the heart of workplace management, you need to be organized. Everything should have a standard place to be stored, and there should be organization in place to keep track of everything. Knowing where things are prevents wastes of time, messes and possible hazards.

#### Standard Systems
There is an infinite amount of possible organizing configurations. Most of these work fine. The focus of organizing should be that everyone involved knows how it is organized. This is called a *standard*. You should establish and abide by a standard when organizing a workplace. Without a standard, the effort of organization is mostly wasted.

#### Grouping
A very common way to organize things is by grouping them in categories. This is popular because it works well, and helps in every respect. Finding things is easy, and hazardous materials have standard placement together to make sure that everywhere else is safe from those materials. Systems like shelves, bins and bags are all useful for grouping.

#### Proper Placement
A component of an organization system is that things are properly placed when finished with. This is a common problem in workplaces, even when a standard system with grouping is set up. It is impossible to keep a workplace organized without the participation of everyone involved. When finished with tools or supplies, you should always put them back exactly where they belong.

## Prevention
Even when a workplace is organized, accidents are still easily encountered. It is the duty of everyone to try to prevent such accidents, in as many ways as possible.

#### Safety Tools
There should be tools in every workplace that can prevent accidents. This includes proper ventilation, clean work spaces and safety equipment. If you are doing anything that could result in any kind of injury, you should be wearing the appropriate safety gear.

#### Proper Equipment
Equipment can vary from wearable protection to safe machinery. Everything that you use in your workplace should be fully functional, safe to use and used with protective gear. It is unacceptable to use broken or unsafe equipment that has any kind of obvious hazard.

#### Training
Every person that enters a workplace should be properly trained for all safety concerns presented by the work going on there. People working with equipment should be fully trained before using the equipment. Training can and should include medical training, such as First Aid and CPR.

## Precautions
If accidents cannot be prevented, they should be prepared for. Precautions are important in the case of any kind of unexpected event. There are many kinds of accidents that happen without any kind of provocation by people, and cannot be avoided. You should be prepared for these.

#### Fire
Although fires are not very common when dealing with electronics, it is always a risk. For that reason, smoke alarms and fire extinguishers should always be located in workplaces. Everyone that works in the workplace should be familiar with these device's location.

In the case of a small fire, use a fire extinguisher. There are kinds of oil fires (chemical fires are much more common from electrics) that will spread when doused with water, so always prefer fire extinguishers. If you do not have one on hand, baking soda can work. Generally, water will only work on wood fires.

#### Explosions
In the case of an explosion, get as low to the ground as possible, and try to find cover. The kinds of explosions you might deal with are usually due to pressure or over-voltage. These explosions can be harmful to skin especially, so avoid them at all costs. Prevention is key for explosions. There is no effective way to take precautions for explosions.

#### Injuries
There should always be at least one first aid kit in every workplace. Phones should also be nearby, to reduce time to call 911 if needed. Someone with first aid experience should always be nearby.

## Regulations
There are safety regulations for workplaces that you should follow. Make sure to verify with a teacher or parent supervisor to ensure your workplace is up to the standard.

#### Fire
There should always be a fire extinguisher and smoke detector somewhere inside of a work space. It is highly recommended to have one in both ends of the room, in case the fire is in the way of getting to the extinguisher.

#### Equipment
Depending on the work that will be done, there is different kinds of regulations for equipment. Be sure to research the safety of your equipment, and what is required to safely use it.
