## Control
Often times, controlling hazards is very easy.

Controlling a hazard is about removing the cause. If there is a spill, remove the thing that is spilling. After you have removed the cause, it is easy to simply clean up.

Remember to use precaution if cleaning up involves any kind of hazardous material. Be sure you properly know how to dispose of the material.
