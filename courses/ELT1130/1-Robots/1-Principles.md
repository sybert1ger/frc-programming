Something difficult about the study of robotics is actually defining what a robot is. There is disagreement everywhere about what constitutes a robot, and what is just a machine. This disagreement, as you can imagine, distracts from the actually interesting topics that form the study.

So for the sake of being productive, we'll define "robot" as something that:

- Is controlled electronically
- Moves
- Has programmed behaviour

This definition gives a broad base, but is specific enough to eliminate most obviously non-robots.

Alright, now that we know what a robot is - how does one go about creating one? There are differing levels of complexity, and the answer to the question depends on what kind of robot you're developing. Say, for example, you want to build a robot that can pick up balls, and drive.

You'll need:

- A drivetrain
- A mechanism to pick up balls
- A way to control the robot

For most robots, you can simplify everything down to these kind of simple goals. It's important to do this as part of your design process.

## The Principles of Robotics
It would be wrong to say that these principles are always adhered to, or even that they are the goals of all robots. They aren't. The purpose of knowing these principles is much more general. As a designer, you will need to have some kind of compass that directs you. There is so much room for error in design, and it can be very easy to go in the wrong direction. Having guiding principles can be a saving grace.

**Principles**

- Prototype before designing
- Design before building
- Iterate design over time
- Keep things as simple as your goal allows
- Allow for modifications

These five principles are all very important.

### Prototype before designing
You should always have an idea about how your ideas work in real life before choosing them. It's just impossible to know exactly how something will work in practicality. Prototyping is inexpensive, and invaluable. Every successful design should start with a simple prototype.

### Design before building
Make sure your design is finalized and complete before you start building. You can end up wasting a lot of time if you don't complete designs. Your design might be perfect in theory, but there are so many more factors to design than completing the desired task.

### Iterate design over time
Your designs will almost never be *good* on the first iteration. This isn't an insult - nobody has the foresight to account for everything. The separating factor between a good and bad design is iteration. You need to constantly re-evaluate, and consider other options. Brilliant ideas don't come on the first try.

### Keep things as simple as your goal allows
This is the most commonly said, and least commonly practised principle in all of design. Of course, everyone *ideally* follows this. There's really no argument for unnecessary complexity. But over and over again, people completely neglect the power of a simple design.

### Allow for modifications
The third principle is useful - but not when you can't make modifications. There's always a possibility that you will need to change things. If you make that process difficult or impossible, you'll be bound to your bad design. You won't have the foresight to see a lot of problems you'll face, but you *will* have the foresight to see that you might need to change things.

So, what's important here? Most of this page can be summarized as "**design is crucial**". Nothing will ever be more important than a robot's design. You can use the best material, strategy, program, electronics and prototypes, but without a unifying and good design, you get nowhere.
