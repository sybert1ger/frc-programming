### 1. What are the three main data types in programs?

+ numbers, booleans, strings
+ numbers, booleans, characters
+ floats, integers, booleans
+ floats, booleans, strings

### 2. What is the difference between an integer and a float?

+ Integers cannot be negative
+ Floats cannot be negative
+ Integers cannot store decimal numbers
+ Floats cannot store decimal numbers

### 3. What would this be equivalent to?

    313.2 >= 323.2

+ `False`
+ `True`
+ Invalid
+ None of the above

### 4. What data type is `'13.2'`?

+ Character
+ String
+ Float
+ Integer

### 5. This code snippet is found inside of a program

    print(isinstance(x, float))

If the program prints `True`, what does that tell us?

+ `x` is a number
+ `x` is a float
+ `x` can be converted to an integer
+ All of the above

### 6. To receive input from the user in the console, what method is used?

+ `getinput()`
+ `str()`
+ `raw_input()`
+ `console.input()`

### 7. What would be the result of `120 % 59`?

+ 0
+ 1
+ 2
+ 2.03

### 8. What is `x` after running this program?

    x = 12 % 5
    
    if x < 1:
        x = 13.4
    elif x < 2:
        x = 12
    else:
        x = x * 2

+ 12
+ 4
+ 13.4
+ 2

### 9. The execution of this program  will eventually end

    x = 13 / 2 == 26 / 4

    while x:
        x = False

+ True
+ False

### 10. This function is technically an algorithm

    def func():
        return 13 / 2

+ True
+ False
