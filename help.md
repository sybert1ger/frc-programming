FRC West has set up its curriculum hosted online. If you are experiencing difficulties with web pages not loading, it is likely a hosting problem that we have no control over.

If the web pages are not loading properly, please make sure you have javascript enabled.

## Navigating
You can find your courses at the top right-hand corner of every page. Every course is available there.

To look at content in courses, find the link on the right-hand side of the screen. All content in the course you're in will show up there.

## Website rendering
